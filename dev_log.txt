2023/10/28:
	Created devlog.
	Added pickups for Boomstick and Big Iron, and correspondingly removed them
			from the player's starting loadout.
	Began working on a basic test enemy. It can detect the player and perform attacks.

2023/10/30:
	Created a basic model for the enemy.
	Going to work on animating it after school, hopefully.
	Also tweaked the glowy eyes to look eviler/angrier.
	This current test enemy is probably going to end up as the Pinkerton.

	After school:
		implemented Pinkerton idle animation.
